# In-Vision
In-vision is website to visualize and interpret inventory data in a new and efficient way. It uses generative AI to help interpret a MySQL Database.

The application uses Google PaLM GenAI model to convert users querie into Mysql commands.These commands are then used to fetch data from the Mysql database.
Along with this I have also made a custom dashboard using PowerBI to visualize the inventory database.

However we must understand that the model can return results which can be retireved using MySQL commands. Hence it may not perform well for complex queries adn questions from the user.

This application has been built using python,langchain,,Mysql,Google PaLM,ChromaDB,PowerBI,Streamlit
